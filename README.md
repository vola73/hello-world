First Repetitory for hello-world tutorial for learning basic git tasks

This is my first rendevous with git and I am eager to learn it.
After accomplishing the first steps using the tutorial, my next step
is to integrate git into XCODE. Now you are aware that I will primarily develop code
for iOS. But in future I will also take on to get used to JAVA again.
